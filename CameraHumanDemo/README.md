-Testing how well newcomers calibrate for the first time.

-Total of 8 test subjects:

> Arlette Gonzalez
>
> Bennett

> Brent Arakaki

> Eugene Hwang

> Ricky Ma

> Vivian Zuo

-Subjects are asked to "fill" the entire green box with the ball. I press SPACE for them to take the picture. Observe the results.

-Image sets include calibration picture, screenshot of entire feed during calibration, and screenshot of entire feed during tracking

Success rate of 1/8 = 12.5% from a strong tendency to fit the ball into the calibration box, rather than the instructions to "fill" the box.
